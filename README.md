# federated-learning-edge-computing
Summary of a thesis section combining Federated Learning and Edge Computing.

## 🌐 What’s Included

This project focuses on the combination of **Federated Learning (FL)** and **Edge Computing**, a topic covered in the following translated sections of the thesis:

- Section 1.1: Edge Computing  
- Section 1.2: Federated Learning  
- Section 1.3: Federated Learning and Edge Computing
> PS:Currently, only the theoretical analysis of federated learning and edge computing is available. The experimental results and implementation code will be gradually added.

## 📌 Why This Matters

As edge devices grow in importance, the fusion of FL and edge computing becomes vital for balancing **privacy**, **computation efficiency**, and **communication cost**. This translation aims to make these ideas accessible to a wider, English-speaking audience.

## 📖 Reference
